Features expected:

 - [x] calculates equations with  - + / *
 - [x] operator priority aware
 - [x] parenthes aware
 - [ ] unar + and -
 - [ ] multiple equations separated by (;)
 - [ ] built-in consts (pi, e)
 - [ ] new const declaration

 - [ ] new function declaration


# Build & Test

```
make
```
